# Lock-Free MPMC Ring Buffer (Ticketed Slots)

Bounded, cache-friendly, **lock-free MPMC** queue for high-throughput ML pipelines.

## Results (Intel/Windows, MSVC19)
- 2P/2C, cap=65,536, batch=32 → **~XX.X Mops/s**
- 4P/4C, cap=131,072, batch=32 → **~201.8 Mops/s**

## Why it’s fast
- Per-slot **sequence tickets** (no ABA).
- **ACQUIRE/RELEASE** publishes/consumes payloads correctly.
- **CAS** on head/tail; indices padded to avoid false sharing.
- **Batch enqueue** (block reserve) + **non-blocking batched dequeue** (claim only ready run).
- Tiny backoff with `_mm_pause()` and **thread affinity** on Windows.

Results & Analysis

We evaluated the lock-free RingMPMC queue under varying workloads on Windows 11 (Visual Studio 2019, Release build). Benchmarks were run with different producer/consumer configurations, queue capacities, and batch sizes.

1. Baseline (Balanced 4P / 4C, Capacity 131072, Batch 32)

Throughput: ~241 Mops/s

Latency (p50/p95/p99): 100 / 200 / 300 ns

Observation: This configuration provides a stable baseline with predictable latency and high throughput.

2. Effect of Queue Capacity
Capacity	Producers/Consumers	Batch	Throughput (Mops/s)	Notes
65536	4 / 4	32	~241	Matches baseline
131072	4 / 4	32	~241	Sweet spot
262144	4 / 4	32	~106	Cache pressure hurts performance

Conclusion: Oversized queues degrade cache locality. A mid-size (64k–128k) capacity is optimal.

3. Effect of Batch Size
Batch Size	Producers/Consumers	Capacity	Throughput (Mops/s)	Notes
16	4 / 4	131072	~167	Smaller batches = higher sync overhead
32	4 / 4	131072	~241	Balanced throughput & latency
64	4 / 4	131072	~280	Best throughput observed

Conclusion: Larger batches reduce per-item synchronization, increasing throughput. Batch=64 yielded the highest throughput (~280 Mops/s).

4. Producer/Consumer Asymmetry
Producers	Consumers	Capacity	Batch	Throughput (Mops/s)	Notes
6	2	131072	32	~173	Consumer bottleneck
2	6	131072	32	~235	Overprovisioned consumers, close to baseline

Conclusion: Performance is sensitive to too few consumers (drain bottleneck) but remains stable with extra consumers.

Summary
Throughput peaks at ~280 Mops/s with balanced workloads (4P/4C, batch 64).
Latency stays predictable across configurations (p50=100ns, p95=200ns, p99=300ns).
Optimal settings for most use cases: capacity 131072, batch 32–64, balanced producer/consumer counts.
Avoid oversizing the queue — larger than 131072 hurts cache locality and reduces throughput.
